            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Web accessibility refers to the ability of people with
              disabilities, such as visual, auditory, physical, speech or
              cognitive, to access and interact with web content. It ensures
              equal access to information and services, enabling everyone to
              participate fully in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve web accessibility, the
              <a href=""> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) </a>
              provide a set of instructions for building websites that everyone
              can use, including people with disabilities. These guidelines are
              created and maintained by experts in the industry and individuals
              with lived experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>WCAG</strong> is based on four main principles,
              namely, <strong>perceivable</strong>, operable, understandable,
              and robust, each of which is further divided into 13 guidelines
              associated with testable success criteria. The success criteria
              are divided into three levels of conformance, known as levels A,
              AA, and AAA.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Perceivable</li>
              <li>Operable</li>
              <li>Understandable</li>
              <li>Robust</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't worry. sa11y is a resource
              that simplifies some of the guidance from WCAG while gradually
              introducing you to concepts.

              Make your way down the page, reviewing each step. By the end, you
              should have completed a thorough accessibility review. Please
              don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issues or find
              anything unclear.

          <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>
              Before we get started, we need to download a tool to run our
              automated tests. We will utilise aXe by Deque University. It's
              free and runs on your web browser. Go ahead and download it.
            </p>
            <a href="www.google.com">Download aXe extension</a>
            <p>
              After you have installed it, let's run-through how to use it.
              First, we need access to the developer tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Keyboard Shortcut: </strong>Open the Developer Tools by
              pressing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mac: </strong><kbd>CMD + SHIFT + i</kbd></li>
              <li><strong>Windows : </strong><kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + i</kbd></li>

            </aside>
            <div>
              <div class="caption-text">
                <strong>Alternatively: </strong>Right-click anywhere on the

              <div class="caption-text">
                Next, click on the little <strong>submenu</strong> located in
                the top right corner of the page and select the
                <strong>aXe DevTools</strong> from the list.

            <a class="external-link" href="">
              Non-text Content (Level A)
              <i class="material-icons"> open_in_new </i>
            </a>
            <p>
              Ensuring images have descriptive text, also known as alt text, is
              crucial for web accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alt text provides a textual alternative to the content of an
              image, allowing users who are blind or visually impaired to
              understand the image's meaning using screen readers or other
              assistive technologies. It also helps with SEO and improves the
              overall accessibility of your website for all users.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review:</h3>
            <strong>Automated review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Run the aXe extension.</li>
              <li>
                Check for any issues refering to <strong>Alt text</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Right-click</strong> on the image you want to check,
                select <strong>inspect</strong> or
                <strong>inspect element</strong> (depending on the browser)
              </li>
              <li>
                While hovering over the image with your cursor, you will get a
                preview which will show wether or not the image has alt text.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/element-preview.svg" alt="" />
            </aside>

            </div>

            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Images that convey information unavailable through other content
                should have an alt tag. <br /><strong>Meaningful: </strong
                ><code>Alt="What gets read goes here"</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Images that provide no information, such as illustrations, must
                be coded as decorative. <br /><strong>Decorative: </strong
                ><code>Alt=""</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                The rule of thumb used to determine whether an image is
                informative is to remove it from the screen: if I am missing
                information because the image is gone, then it means the image
                is informative and needs alt text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check any images with alt text are descriptive and relevant.
                This requires some manual intervention, but we want to ensure
                alt text is accurate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's run through an example below.</p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/CathyFreeman_5.jpeg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <div>
              <div class="caption-text">

              </div>
            </div>

            <strong>Good alt text: </strong>

              <code>

                backdrop."</code
              >
            </p>
            <strong>Poor alt text: </strong>
            <p><code>alt="A group of marathon runners."</code></p>
            <strong>Bad alt text: </strong>

            <h2>Headings and structure</h2>
            <p>
              Headings structure your web page content, organizing it into a
              hierarchy and making it easier for users to navigate and
              understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also play a crucial role in SEO. Ensuring headings follow a
              logical structure, with proper nesting (H1, H2, H3, etc.), is
              essential for accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers,
              navigate web pages primarily using headings. A logical heading
              structure allows them to efficiently grasp the page's content and
              organization.
            </p>

            <h2>Colours</h2>
            <p>
              Colour contrast refers to the difference in brightness between two
              colours. Sufficient color contrast is essential for ensuring the
              readability of text and other visual elements on your website.
              Users with low vision or colour blindness may struggle to read
              text with poor colour contrast, making it crucial to verify that
              your website meets the recommended contrast ratios.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Aim for a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong> for
                normal text and large text and <strong>7:1</strong> for small
                text to ensure readability for most users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use colours purposefully to convey information, create
                hierarchy, and enhance the user experience. Avoid relying solely
                on colour to differentiate information, as users with colour
                blindness might not perceive the intended meaning.

            <h2>Navigation</h2>
            <p>
              Keyboard navigation allows users to interact with web elements
              using the keyboard instead of a mouse. This is essential for users
              with motor impairments or who use screen readers, as they rely
              solely on the keyboard to navigate and interact with websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing keyboard navigation ensures that all interactive elements,
              such as <strong>buttons</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, and
              <strong>forms</strong>, can be accessed and operated using the
              keyboard.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Using your keyboard, check that all interactive elements
                (buttons, links, or anything that can be interacted with) can be
                reached using the <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys. Can
                you navigate through the whole page with just the keyboard?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All interactive elements must have a visual indicator when in
                focus. This is typically a border or colour change when tabbed
                through.
              </li>
              <li>
                The order in which you tab through the elements should be
                consistent with how you read or navigate the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure you can visibly see where the focus is; you shouldn't be

              accessing website links may pose a challenge if they are not clear

            <p>
              Therefore, it is essential to ensure that links are visible and
              have meaningful and descriptive text that accurately conveys the
              information that the user will access by clicking on the link.
              This approach not only enhances web accessibility but also

            <h2>Responsive content</h2>
            <p>
              Many users rely on zooming in to read text, view images, and
              interact with page elements. A website that can be navigated and
              used easily at high zoom levels, without the need for horizontal
              scrolling, provides a better experience for these users.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Open your browser settings. Look for the zoom option, which is
                typically available in the menu or settings panel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Increase the zoom level to <strong>400%</strong>. This simulates
                what content might look like to a user who needs content to be
                enlarged to see it more clearly.
              </li>
              <li>
                At a <strong>400%</strong> zoom, check if all the page content
                fits within the viewport and is usable without needing to scroll
                horizontally.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Exceptions to horizontal scrolling:</strong>
            While horizontal scrolling should generally be avoided, there are
            exceptions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Large tables that contain a lot of information may require
                horizontal scrolling to view all the data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Photos, maps, charts, and certain games that are designed to be
                wide may also necessitate horizontal scrolling.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interfaces with toolbars or panels that are an integral part of
                the navigation or functionality.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using responsive design principles to ensure content reflows and
                adapts to various screen sizes and zoom levels. Use flexible
                layouts and scalable images to accommodate different viewing
                conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure that text remains legible at high zoom levels. Avoid
                fixed font sizes in pixels; use relative units like ems or rems
                instead, which scale better when zoomed in.
              </li>
              <li>
                Test that all navigational elements like <strong>menus</strong>,
                <strong>links</strong>, and <strong>buttons</strong> are fully
                accessible and operable at increased zoom levels. Users should
                be able to access all parts of the site without difficulty.
              </li>
