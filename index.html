            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Web accessibility refers to the ability of people with
              disabilities, such as visual, auditory, physical, speech or
              cognitive, to access and interact with web content. It ensures
              equal access to information and services, enabling everyone to
              participate fully in the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve web accessibility, the Web Content Accessibility
              Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of instructions for building
              websites that everyone can use, including people with
              disabilities. These guidelines are created and maintained by
              experts in the industry and individuals with lived experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The WCAG is based on four main principles, namely, perceivable,
              operable, understandable, and robust, each of which is further
              divided into 13 guidelines associated with testable success
              criteria. The success criteria are divided into three levels of
              conformance, known as levels A, AA, and AAA.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't worry. sa11y is a resource
              that simplifies some of the guidance from WCAG while gradually
              introducing you to concepts.

              Make your way down the page, reviewing each step. By the end, you
              should have completed a thorough accessibility review. Please
              don't hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issues or find
              anything unclear.

          <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>
              Before we get started, we need to download a tool to run our
              automated tests. We will utilise aXe by Deque University. It's
              free and runs on your web browser. Go ahead and download it.
            </p>
            <a href="www.google.com">Download aXe extension</a>
            <p>
              After you have installed it, let's run-through how to use it.
              First, we need access to the developer tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Keyboard Shortcut: </strong>Open the Developer Tools by
              pressing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mac: </strong><kbd>CMD + SHIFT + i</kbd></li>
              <li><strong>Windows : </strong><kbd>CTRL + SHIFT + i</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Alternatively: </strong>Right-click anywhere on the
              webpage and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" (depending on
              the browser).
            </p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/inspect.svg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <p>
              Next, click on the little submenu located in the top right corner
              of the page and select the aXe tool from the list.
            </p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/inspect.svg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <p>
              Click on the <strong>Scan page</strong> button and wait for it to
              complete the scan. Any issues detected will be displayed at the
              bottom of the page.
            </p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/inspect.svg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <p>
              Although it may appear overwhelming if lots of issues appear, this
              page will help guide you to focus on certian ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that you have downloaded the extension, you can review any of
              the following points below.
            </p>
          </section>
          <div class="content-divider"></div>
          <section id="images">
            <h2>Images</h2>
            <a class="external-link" href="">
              Non-text Content (Level A)
              <i class="material-icons"> open_in_new </i>
            </a>
            <p>
              Ensuring images have descriptive text, also known as alt text, is
              crucial for web accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alt text provides a textual alternative to the content of an
              image, allowing users who are blind or visually impaired to
              understand the image's meaning using screen readers or other
              assistive technologies. It also helps with SEO and improves the
              overall accessibility of your website for all users.
            </p>
            <h3>How to check:</h3>
            <strong>Automated check:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Run the aXe extension.</li>
              <li>
                Check for any issues refering to <strong>Alt text</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <strong>Manual check:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Right-click</strong> on the image you want to check,
                select <strong>inspect</strong> or
                <strong>inspect element</strong> (depending on the browser)
              </li>
              <li>
                While hovering over the image with your cursor, you will get a
                preview which will show wether or not the image has alt text.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/element-preview.svg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <p class="caption">
              Element preview displays when you hover over an element with your
              mouse, while the developer tools are open.
            </p>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Images that convey information unavailable through other content
                should have an alt tag. <br /><strong>Meaningful: </strong
                ><code>Alt="What gets read goes here"</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Images that provide no information, such as illustrations, must
                be coded as decorative. <br /><strong>Decorative: </strong
                ><code>Alt=""</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                The rule of thumb used to determine whether an image is
                informative is to remove it from the screen: if I am missing
                information because the image is gone, then it means the image
                is informative and needs alt text.
              </li>
              <li>
                Check any images with alt text are descriptive and relevant.
                This requires some manual intervention, but we want to ensure
                alt text is accurate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's run through an example below.</p>
            <aside class="responsive-image">
              <img src="assets/CathyFreeman_5.jpeg" alt="" />
            </aside>
            <p class="caption">

            </p>
            <strong>Good alt text: </strong>
            <p>
              <code>

                backdrop."</code
              >
            </p>
            <strong>Poor alt text: </strong>
            <p><code>alt="A group of marathon runners."</code></p>
            <strong>Bad alt text: </strong>
            <p><code>alt="image2343.jpeg"</code></p>
            <p class="italic">
              Avoid at all cost using the image name as alt text.

              <strong>Why this helps</strong>
              <div>

                  >It can be difficult for individuals who are visually impaired
                  to interpret images. Correct markup and good text alternatives
                  make them accessible to everyone. Actual text is better than
                  images of text because it can be adjusted for
                  legibility.</span
                >
              </div>
            </aside>
            <h3>Additional resources</h3>

            <h2>Headings and structure</h2>
            <p>
              Headings structure your web page content, organizing it into a
              hierarchy and making it easier for users to navigate and
              understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              They also play a crucial role in SEO. Ensuring headings follow a
              logical structure, with proper nesting (H1, H2, H3, etc.), is
              essential for accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users who rely on assistive technologies, such as screen readers,
              navigate web pages primarily using headings. A logical heading
              structure allows them to efficiently grasp the page's content and
              organization.
            </p>

              <li>
                Headings should not skip levels (e.g., H1 to H3). Headings of

            <h2>Colours</h2>
            <p>
              Colour contrast refers to the difference in brightness between two
              colours. Sufficient color contrast is essential for ensuring the
              readability of text and other visual elements on your website.
              Users with low vision or colour blindness may struggle to read
              text with poor colour contrast, making it crucial to verify that
              your website meets the recommended contrast ratios.
            </p>

              <strong>Alternatively: </strong>You can use a tool like
              <a href=""> WebAIM's Contrast Checker </a> to ensure text and
              background colors meet accessibility standards. Simply grab the
              two hex values you want to check and enter them in.

            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Aim for a contrast ratio of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong> for
                normal text and large text and <strong>7:1</strong> for small
                text to ensure readability for most users.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use colours purposefully to convey information, create
                hierarchy, and enhance the user experience. Avoid relying solely
                on colour to differentiate information, as users with colour
                blindness might not perceive the intended meaning.

                  distinguish the importance of a heading by its visual
                  appearance, with higher-level headings generally having
                  greater visual prominence than lower-level ones.</span

            <h2>Navigation</h2>
            <p>
              Keyboard navigation allows users to interact with web elements
              using the keyboard instead of a mouse. This is essential for users
              with motor impairments or who use screen readers, as they rely
              solely on the keyboard to navigate and interact with websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Testing keyboard navigation ensures that all interactive elements,
              such as <strong>buttons</strong>, <strong>links</strong>, and
              <strong>forms</strong>, can be accessed and operated using the
              keyboard.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Using your keyboard, check that all interactive elements
                (buttons, links, or anything that can be interacted with) can be
                reached using the <kbd>tab</kbd> and <kbd>arrow</kbd> keys. Can
                you navigate through the whole page with just the keyboard?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All interactive elements must have a visual indicator when in
                focus. This is typically a border or colour change when tabbed
                through.
              </li>
              <li>
                The order in which you tab through the elements should be
                consistent with how you read or navigate the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure you can visibly see where the focus is; you shouldn't be
                able to focus on an element hidden or out of view.
              </li>
            </ul>

              </div>
              <div class="caption-text">
                Typically when an element is in focus it will have a border
                around the whole element.
              </div>
            </div>
            <aside class="responsive-image">

              <div class="caption-text">
                The tab order should match the visual flow of elements.

              <strong>Why this helps</strong>
              <div>
                <span class="callout-content"
                  >Web apps must let users navigate through all interactive
                  components using a keyboard. If users can't access these
                  components, they won't be able to use the app. Keyboard
                  navigation is especially critical for people with blindness,
                  low vision, or hand tremors who rely on it to access these
                  elements.</span

            <h2>links</h2>
            <p>
              On the web, links enable users to navigate from one webpage to
              another. However, for users with disabilities or impairments,
              accessing website links may pose a challenge if they are not clear
              and descriptive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, it is essential to ensure that links are visible and
              have meaningful and descriptive text that accurately conveys the
              information that the user will access by clicking on the link.
              This approach not only enhances web accessibility but also
              improves the overall user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>How to review</h3>
            <strong>Manual review:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Look for underlined text or icons that typically indicate links.
                Hovering over the text or icon might also change the cursor to a
                hand symbol, further suggesting a link.
              </li>
              <li>
                Inspect a webpage link by right-clicking and select "Inspect"
                (or "Inspect Element"). Locate the element and check for an
                <code>a</code> tag with an href attribute that specifies the
                link's URL.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>Alternatively: </strong>If your on a mac and are feeling
              confident, you can use the voiceOver rotor menu to quickly show a
              list of all links.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Press <kbd>Control + Option + U</kbd> to activate the Rotor
                Menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                Alternatively, you can customize this key combination by going
                to
                <strong
                  >System Preferences > Accessibility > VoiceOver >
                  Rotor</strong

              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best practices</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Review each link to ensure its text clearly describes where the
                link goes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use unique text for unique links and consistent text for links
                to the same destination.
              </li>
              <li>
                Indicate links that open in new tabs with an external icon and
                announcement.
              </li>
